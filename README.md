WELCOME!!

In this project repository is a showcase of all the work that was done in my CSC 455  class. Throughtout the semester I had been pushing and pulling this repository so much when jumping between laptops and desktop. SO I have always been working these files on the go whether it was at school, work or when I was traveling to Mexico for a funeral, I was using this repository throughout the semester to always work on something.

So thank you for checking this out and let me explain this repository better.
